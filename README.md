# React Landing page - Interface

## Design assets
* Invision public URL: https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/5WQPC1IJM9N
* You should also have been added to the board to have access to the inspect tab.

## Instructions
Attached you will find two screenshots representing two content blocks in a page. Complete the following:
* Builds two blocks using modern HTML5 standards.
* Builds a container area to house the two sections; there are no dimensional requirements for this although we're looking for something similar to bootstrap's `.container` class.
* Uses JavaScript to capture all anchor clicks, and `console.log()` the element which has been clicked.
* As with any modern web-build we expect a level of interactivity/animation to be displayed on the nodes.
* All content areas deemed as being populated from a CMS - so all copy lengths can vary.

## Technologies
* React
* CSS-preprocessors - SASS Used
* CSS frameworks (Bootstrap)

## Layout
* The layout is expected to work in the latest Chrome/FireFox/Edge versions.
* The layout is responsive and works down to a `320px` mobile device.
* Bearing in mind that this application is responsive, the appropriate `<meta>` tags are provided.
* *Section: All the latest:* Each image displays in a modal on click.
* *Section: Answer your body's needs:* These items are links to new pages.

## Criteria
This react component static design process considers:
* *Project structure:* Clean project and logical traversal.
* *JavaScript:* Efficiency of code and efficacy in bringing the design to life.
* *Interface:* Semantic markup and styling.
* *Git:* Bonus points for submission on a github account showing multiple commits.
* *Quality:* Production-grade.

Project Starter:

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm start`
In the project directory, you can run to start up the web application:
